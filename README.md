### How we build this project:
    - Collecting and cleaning Data.
    - Build and train a classifer model using CNN and tensorflow 2.x (Python, colab, spider)
    - Optimize and covert the model into tf lite format.
    - Build an application on android studio (Java) and save model file inside a folder within application.
    - That application will take input (using camera) from user and then call tf lite model and pass that image through it.
    - The model will return classes/output which will reflected to user.
    - This application works totally offline (Privacy) as well as fast.
